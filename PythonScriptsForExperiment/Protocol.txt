In order to run both the angle_live_plots.py and EMG_live_plots.py files: 
	- open two powershells
	- move to the correct directory
	- in powershell 1 perform command py .\A_angle_live_plots.py
	- in powershell 2 perform command py .\B_UDP_Myo_broadcaster.py
To run with the Hololens applications:
	1) Run .py files
	2) Then run the app (.sln)
	3) Close angle_live_plots.py 
	4) Close EMG_live_plots.py

2) run .\A_angle_live_plots.py which contains the GUI
3) enter details for participant
4) run other two scripts when ready to start recording a trial in the seperate powershells
5) close the GUI window; keyboard interrupt the other two shells with Ctrl+c
